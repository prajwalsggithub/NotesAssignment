# NotesAssignment

Hello,
I have developed a Notes Service backend using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB (Mongoose).
Schema Design: Created a Note model with content field (required) and automatic createdAt and updatedAt timestamps.
REST APIs:
POST /notes – To create a new note.
GET /notes – To fetch all notes.
GET /notes/:id – To fetch a note by ID.
Project Structure: Followed MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture for better code organization (models, controllers, routes, config).
Environment Config: Used .env file to store MongoDB connection details securely.
The project is structured cleanly to highlight clarity, modularity, and best practices for a basic backend service.
Thank you for reviewing my submission
